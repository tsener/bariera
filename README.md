# bariera

## Description
Some repo to store what triggers the barrier automation.
Just in case, if SD cards is toaasted ,backup is lost, etc.

One would need to set a hostname (I use duckDNS or similar) 
and also HTTP header is required to authorize the call.

There is also rate-limiting in the nginx conf, and specific 
sleep times are per the original BFT remote.
